In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2025winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](images/10001217_adt.png) Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10063848 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](images/10001217_icu.png)

Do a similar visualization for the patient `10063848`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

```{r}
icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz")
```

### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

```{r}
# Count unique subject_id
num_unique_subjects <- icustays_tble%>% 
  distinct(subject_id) %>% 
  nrow()

print(paste("Number of unique subjects:", num_unique_subjects))
```

```{r}
library(plotly)

# Count ICU stays per subject
icu_stays_per_subject <- icustays_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_stays = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution
p <- ggplot(icu_stays_per_subject, aes(x = num_stays)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#1B9E76", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +  # Use histogram with bin width 1
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +  # Limit X-axis to focus on the majority of data
  labs(title = "Distribution of ICU Stays per Subject",
       x = "Number of ICU Stays",
       y = "Count of Subjects") +
  theme_minimal()  # Use a clean theme for better readability

# Convert to an interactive plot
ggplotly(p)

```

The histogram shows the distribution of ICU stays per subject (patient). Most subjects have only one ICU stay, with a sharp drop-off as the number of stays increases. The majority of patients (49,124 subjects) had a single ICU stay, while a much smaller proportion experienced multiple ICU stays. This suggests that repeated ICU admissions are uncommon, but some patients do return multiple times, possibly due to chronic conditions, post-surgical complications, or severe illnesses requiring multiple admissions. The long tail of the distribution indicates that a few patients had 10 or more ICU stays, though these cases are rare.

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

```{r}
admissions_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz")
```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

-   number of admissions per patient\
-   admission hour (anything unusual?)\
-   admission minute (anything unusual?)\
-   length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting),

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

-   **number of admissions per patient**

```{r}
# Compute the number of admissions per patient
admissions_per_patient <- admissions_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(num_admissions = n(), .groups = "drop")

# Create a histogram to visualize the distribution
p <- ggplot(admissions_per_patient, aes(x = num_admissions)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#D81B60", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) + # Use histogram instead of bar chart
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +  # Limit the X-axis to focus on the most relevant range
  labs(title = "Number of Admissions per Patient",
       x = "Admissions per Patient",
       y = "Count of Patients") +
  theme_minimal()  # Use a clean theme for better readability

# Convert to an interactive plot
ggplotly(p)

```

Most patients have only one or very few admissions, while very few patients have a large number of admissions. A small number of patients have multiple hospitalizations, but the frequency drops quickly as the number of admissions increases. Patients with 10+ admissions are very rare. The distribution is heavily right-skewed, with very few patients experiencing more than 5 hospital stays. This means that most patients have a low number of admissions, and a small subset of patients has a significantly higher number. Also, Most hospital patients are one-time visitors, while a minority (likely with chronic illnesses or complications) are readmitted multiple times.

-   **admission hour (anything unusual?)**

```{r}
# Extract hour from admission time
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_hour = hour(admittime))

# Create a histogram of admission hours
p_hour <- ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = admission_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#1E88E5", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 23, by = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Admission Hours",
       x = "Hour of Admission",
       y = "Count of Admissions") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(p_hour)

```

The distribution of admission hours shows notable patterns. There is a sharp peak at midnight (00:00), suggesting that many admissions are recorded at the start of the day, possibly due to administrative rounding or batch processing of records. Another smaller peak is observed around 07:00–08:00, which could be associated with morning shift changes or scheduled hospital admissions. Admissions increase steadily from late morning and peak between 16:00–19:00, likely reflecting patient arrivals after daytime medical consultations and emergency cases during evening hours. The pattern indicates a combination of systemic recording practices, scheduled admissions, and emergency patient arrivals.

-   **admission minute (anything unusual?)**

```{r}
# Extract minute from admission time
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_minute = minute(admittime))

# Create a histogram of admission minutes
p_minute <- ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = admission_minute)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#FFC107", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 59, by = 5)) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Admission Minutes",
       x = "Minute of Admission",
       y = "Count of Admissions") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(p_minute)


```

The distribution of admission minutes shows distinct spikes at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes, suggesting that admission times are often rounded to quarter-hour intervals. This pattern likely arises due to manual data entry practices, hospital system constraints, or administrative processes that batch-record admissions. The relatively uniform distribution in other minutes indicates that some admissions occur naturally without rounding, but the spikes highlight a systemic bias in how times are logged. This could impact time-based analyses and should be accounted for in further data processing.

-   **length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)**

```{r}
# Calculate length of stay in days
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(length_of_stay = as.numeric(difftime(dischtime, admittime, units = "days")))

# Create a histogram of hospital stay length
p_los <- ggplot(admissions_tble, aes(x = length_of_stay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "#4CAF50", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +  # Adjusted limit for visualization
  labs(title = "Distribution of Hospital Stay Length",
       x = "Length of Stay (Days)",
       y = "Count of Admissions") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(p_los)

```

The distribution of hospital stay length is right-skewed, with most admissions having a short length of stay. The majority of patients are discharged within a few days, with the highest count around 1–3 days, suggesting that many hospital visits are for short-term treatments or observations. As the length of stay increases, the number of admissions decreases, indicating that extended hospitalizations are less common. The presence of a long tail suggests that a small number of patients require prolonged hospital care, possibly due to severe or chronic conditions. This pattern is typical in hospital data, where most cases are routine and resolved quickly, while complex cases require extended stays.

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

```{r}
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz")
```

### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution：

```{r}
# Count the number of patients by gender
gender_dist <- patients_tble %>%
  count(gender)

# Bar plot for gender distribution
p_gender <- ggplot(gender_dist, aes(x = gender, y = n, fill = gender)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Count of Patients") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(p_gender)

```

The bar chart indicates that there are more female (F) patients than male (M) patients in the dataset. The difference is noticeable but not extreme, suggesting a slight gender imbalance in hospital admissions. This could be influenced by factors such as longer life expectancy in females, higher healthcare utilization rates among women, or specific hospital demographics.

```{r}
# Histogram of anchor_age
p_age <- ggplot(patients_tble, aes(x = anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "#1E88E5", color = "black", alpha = 0.8) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Anchor Age",
       x = "Age (Years)",
       y = "Count of Patients") +
  theme_minimal()

# Convert to interactive plot
ggplotly(p_age)
```

The histogram of anchor_age shows a bimodal distribution, with a large concentration of patients in the 20–30 age range and another broader peak between 50–70 years old. The younger peak could represent a large number of maternity-related or younger adult admissions, while the older peak likely reflects age-related chronic conditions and elderly care. The drop-off after 80 years suggests a lower number of very elderly patients, possibly due to lower life expectancy or selection bias in hospital records.

## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](images/labevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

```{r}
# Load lab events dataset from Parquet (keeping it in Arrow format)
labevents_table <- open_dataset("~/biostat-203b-2025-winter/hw3/labevents_pq", format = "parquet")

# Load ICU stays dataset (keeping in Arrow format)
icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz", 
                          col_types = cols(subject_id = col_double(), 
                                           stay_id = col_double(),
                                           intime = col_datetime(format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")))

# Define the required lab test IDs
lab_items <- c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)

```

```{r}
# Step 1: Filter lab events for selected items
filtered_labs <- labevents_table %>%
  filter(itemid %in% lab_items)

# Step 2: Merge with ICU stays to retain only relevant patients
filtered_labs <- filtered_labs %>%
  inner_join(icustays_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%
  filter(charttime < intime)  # Keep only lab measurements before ICU admission

# Step 3: Compute latest `charttime` per subject, stay, and itemid
latest_times <- filtered_labs %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  summarise(last_charttime = max(charttime), .groups = "drop")  # Get latest charttime

# Step 4: Join back with filtered_labs to get the corresponding values
latest_labs <- filtered_labs %>%
  inner_join(latest_times, by = c("subject_id", "stay_id", "itemid", "charttime" = "last_charttime"))

# Step 5: Collect only the final summarized dataset (reduces memory usage)
latest_labs <- latest_labs %>% collect()

# Step 6: Reshape data to have one row per ICU stay (spread itemid into columns)
final_labevents <- latest_labs %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, itemid, value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = itemid, values_from = value)

# Rename columns for readability
colnames(final_labevents) <- c("subject_id", "stay_id", 
                               "creatinine", "potassium", "sodium", 
                               "chloride", "bicarbonate", "hematocrit", 
                               "wbc", "glucose")

# View final dataset
head(final_labevents)
```

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`.

```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement.

![](images/chartevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Solution:

```{r}
# Load chartevents dataset from Parquet (using the linked directory)
chartevents_table <- open_dataset("~/biostat-203b-2025-winter/hw3/chartevents_pq", format = "parquet")

icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz",
                          col_types = cols(subject_id = col_double(), 
                                           stay_id = col_double(),
                                           intime = col_datetime(format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")))

# Define the required vital sign item IDs
vital_items <- c(220045, 220179, 220180, 223761, 220210)

# Step 1: Filter chartevents to include only selected vital signs
filtered_vitals <- chartevents_table %>%
  filter(itemid %in% vital_items)

# Step 2: Merge with ICU stays to keep only relevant patients
filtered_vitals <- filtered_vitals %>%
  inner_join(icustays_tble, by = "subject_id") %>%

  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  summarise(first_charttime = min(charttime), .groups = "drop")  # Get earliest charttime

```

```{r}

# Step 4: Join back with filtered_vitals to get the corresponding values
first_vitals <- filtered_vitals %>%

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` \>= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

-   all variables in `icustays_tble`\
-   all variables in `admissions_tble`\
-   all variables in `patients_tble`
-   the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble`
-   the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs the first vital measurements within the ICU stay

-   Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit
